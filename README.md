# Hospital Management API 🏥✨

## Overview 🌟
Welcome to the **Hospital Management API**! This API is designed to streamline the backend operations of a hospital, enabling seamless management of **appointments**, **doctor schedules**, **patient information**, **staff details**, and **department allocations**. Built with **Spring Boot**, this project offers a clean and modular architecture to handle hospital-related operations with ease.

The API is structured around key entities like:
- **Appointment** 📅
- **Department** 🏥
- **Doctor** 👨‍⚕️👩‍⚕️
- **Patient** 🧑‍⚕️
- **Staff** 👩‍💻👨‍💻

Each entity has its own set of **Controllers**, **Services**, and **Repositories** to ensure clean separation of concerns and easy scalability. 

## Project Structure 📂

To help you navigate through the project code, here's an overview of the folder structure:

HospitalApi/ │ └── src/ │ └── main/ │ └── java/ │ └── com/ │ └── HospitalManagement/ │ └── HospitalApi/ ├── Controller/ # Handles the routes for various endpoints ├── Model/ # Defines database schemas (Entities) ├── Repository/ # Interfaces for database interactions ├── Service/ # Contains methods for endpoint actions ├── Home.java # Entry point to the application └── Application.java # Main application class




### Breakdown of Folders 📂

- **Controller** 🚀: This folder contains all the **REST Controllers** responsible for defining the various routes (API endpoints). Each controller corresponds to an entity (e.g., `AppointmentController`, `PatientController`, etc.) and manages the incoming requests.

- **Model** 📑: The **Model** folder holds all the **entity classes** that define the database schema for different entities. Each class represents an entity in the hospital system like `Appointment`, `Doctor`, `Patient`, etc.

- **Repository** 💾: In this folder, you’ll find the **Repository interfaces** that interact with the database. They extend the `JpaRepository` to handle all CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for each entity.

- **Service** 🛠️: The **Service** folder includes all the **business logic** for your application. It defines the methods that are invoked by the controllers and contains the core functionality for operations like booking appointments, assigning doctors to patients, etc.

- **Home.java** 🏠: This is the main class that starts the Spring Boot application. It’s where everything begins!
